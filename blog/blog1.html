                <h3 class="pb-2 pt-5">LEADERSHIP</h3>
                <p>The ability to lead is not set at birth. Leadership is not a natural(born) gift. However, a person can have some 
                    natural gifts that will help him lead at a higher level. Leadership is the ability of someone to lead others; 
                    ability to obtain followers. 
                </p>
                <p>Leadership is like maturity; it doesn’t come with age. Everyone has a potential to become a leader, it is developed
                   by anyone willing to put in the effort. Leadership is influence; a leader influences those he leads.
                </p>
                <p>Everyone is a leader and a follower. This is so because everyone influences someone. And we don’t always know who and 
                    how much we influence. While title and position are a good place to start in leadership, it is a bad place to stay. 
                    Leadership isn’t just about title and position. Real leadership is how much influence you have on those you are leading
                     and how much value you add to them.
                </p>
                <p>Human relationship is an essential characteristic of leadership. A person with good human relationship tends to be a 
                    good leader. Like the saying goes, <em>“people won’t go along with you if they can’t get along with you”</em>. Leadership 
                    requires you to truly care for people. It involves building solid and lasting relationship with those you lead. 
                    A true leader must have the true interest of his followers at heart. However, leadership doesn’t just stop at building
                    good human relationship. A leader also adds value to relationships. Leadership builds and develop people. You lead to 
                    produce result and develop those you lead. Development? Yes, a leader develops those he leads. 
                    Leaders become great not because of their power but by their ability to empower others.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Below are some keys to leadership.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Priority:</strong> time cannot be managed or changed; we can’t add to it nor subtract from it. A leader must be wise enough
                         to know what to do at the right time; 
                        knowing what to overlook and the things to focus on at a given time. A leader must know how to set priorities!
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Character:</strong> <em>“A man of character will make himself worthy of any position he is given” &mdash; 
                        Mahatma Gandhi</em>. A person is not born with a good character or a bad character, both are developed and improved. 
                        Working on one’s character is a never ending yet totally worthwhile effort. It helps you to be what you want to be. 
                        Good character builds trust in your followers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vision:</strong> all leaders have one thing in common. They see <em>"more and before"</em> others. 
                        A leader must have a vision he pursues and intentionally work towards leading his followers to achieve this vision.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Service:</strong> leaders live to serve. The heart of leadership is based on serving others and not one’s self. 
                        A good leader is a servant-leader.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Problem solving:</strong> <em>“The problem promise: when you handle them well, problems promises to make you better”.</em>
                        The quickest way to gain leadership is problem-solving. Problem introduces us to ourselves; problem introduces us to others and
                         problems introduces us to opportunities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Becoming a better leader changes life. It will add to your effectiveness, subtract from your weakness, divide your 
                    workload and multiply your impact. Being a leader starts right you are and the price to pay for leadership is 
                   <strong>self-discipline</strong>.
