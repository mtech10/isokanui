                <h3 class="pb-2 pt-5">NOW ARE WE SONS OF GOD!</h3>
                <p><strong><em>“As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the 
                    kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.  All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings 
                    of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, 
                    God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions &mdash; it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us 
                    up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches 
                    of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith &mdash; and this not from 
                    yourselves, it is the gift of God &mdash; not by works, so that no one can boast.” &mdash; Eph 2:1-9[NIV]</em></strong> 
                </p>
                <p>The text above clearly explains what salvation entails. It shows us the state of a man who hasn’t believed in the gospel of our Lord Jesus &mdash; living in 
                    darkness; dead in sin. It also gives us an insight into the state of a man who believes. The believer is made alive in Christ Jesus and is seated with
                    Christ in heavenly places at the right hand of the father. And according to John 1:12, has been given the right to become a child of God.
                </p>
                <p>The salvation experience changes the position of a man. In other words, our salvation gives us a position-in Christ.
                </p>
                <p>In Colossians 1:13, Paul helps us to understand that a man who believes is translated (moved) from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God. 
                    In our opening text we se that a man who believes in Christ Jesus is moved from death to life. A believer is moved from being a slave to sin and 
                    Satan to being a victor and a free man, seated with Christ in heavenly places &mdash; having authority.
                </p>
                <p>One major position that salvation puts the believer is the position of sonship.</p>
                <p><strong><em>
                    “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” &mdash; John 1:12[NIV]
                </em></strong></p>
                <p>Upon believing the gospel, we become born again; born of God [John 3:3-8]. Faith in the saving works of Jesus doesn’t just save you from the hands of 
                    the devil, it brings you into the household of God [Ephesians 1:19]. It gives you the authority to call God “Father!”
                </p>
                <p>Being a child of God means that God’s spirit lives inside of you. The holy spirit is the spirit of sonship [Romans 8:15]. The Holy spirit in a man is 
                    the guarantee -evidence- that he is saved, hence a child of God [Ephesians 1:13]. Anyone, just as the bible says in Romans 8:9b, that doesn’t have the
                    spirit of God in him is none of God’s. the Holy spirit therefore is our seal, our proof of sonship.
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>“And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ…because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons
                    of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, 
                    Father." The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.” &mdash; Romans 8:9b,14-16 [NIV]</em></strong> 
                </p>
                <p>Children look like their parents. Sons of God look like their father -God. The spirit of God in every believer confers on us the nature of God. We’re 
                    born of God, hence we ought to live like him. As children of God, we show forth the ways and works of our Father just like Ephesians 2:10 tells us, 
                    we are saved unto good works: we are God’s workmanship.
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>    “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does 
                    not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might 
                    live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, 
                    since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made
                    complete in us. We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit”. &mdash; 1 John 4:7-13[NIV]</em></strong> 
                </p>
                <p>The realities of a child of God is clearly spelt out in the Bible (especially in the epistles). A child of God is one who has been redeemed (from sin, 
                    from the devil, from the curse of the law; Colossians 1:14).  A child of God is forgiven and justified [Romans 8:1]. A child of God is blessed with 
                    all spiritual blessing in the heavenlies [Eph 1:3]. It is therefore expedient of children of God to know all that is theirs in Christ Jesus and walk 
                    in the light of these realities. This is the way a child of God lives in his rightful estate &mdash; victorious.
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>“I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ”.
                    &mdash; Philemon 1:6</em></strong> 
                </p>
                <p>Being children comes with responsibilities. The great commission to go into the world and make disciples -sons- of all nations is a responsibility for
                    all sons of God [Matthew 24:19-20]. It is our father’s business hence every child of God has a part to play. Our goal? To see the earth covered with 
                    the glory of the knowledge of God!
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>” How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the 
                    world does not know us is that it did not know him.  Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But 
                    we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.” &mdash; I John3:1&2</em></strong>
